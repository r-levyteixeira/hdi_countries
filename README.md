# Developed countries classification

In this project, we are interested in classifying countries using different economic, social and environmental indicators as well as HDI. For this purpose, we use open data from ND-Gain (https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/) as well as the list of developed countries from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2022/01/weodata/groups.htm#ae).

Here, we use a mix of unsupervised and supervised approaches to predict if a country is developed or not (we use PCA and Random Forest). In the second part, we show that based on different indicators (without HDI), is possible to do a simple linear regression to obtain the HDI. We perform a simple statistical analysis to obtain the error of $\pm 0.05$

# Instructions

The data is available on ND-Gain website. For this project we used https://gain.nd.edu/assets/499702/nd_gain_country_index_data_update07.2022.zip . Please note that it might be updated later, for more information visit https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/download-data/.

# Disclaimer

This work isn`t related to ND-Gain or IMF. This project should not be used to guide any public policy. This project was done out of curiosity about how different indicators might influence HDI and if it has a relationship with developed nations.
